### Project Description:
SolverPro is an online calculator that provides access to different numerical methods, offering a wide catalog so you can choose the method that best suits your project. Designed for students, engineers, and professionals, SolverPro simplifies the process of solving complex math problems efficiently and accurately, featuring an intuitive interface and real-time results.

We will be using technologies/languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the React library for the front-end of the application. For the backend, we will use JavaScript along with the Node.js runtime and the Express framework. The database we will use is MongoDB.

### Possible Added Values:
- English
- LaTeX

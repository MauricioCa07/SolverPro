### Project Description:
SolverPro is an online calculator that provides access to different numerical methods, offering a wide catalog so you can choose the method that best suits your project. Designed for students, engineers, and professionals, SolverPro simplifies the process of solving complex math problems efficiently and accurately, featuring an intuitive interface and real-time results.

We will be using technologies/languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with the React library for the front-end of the application. For the backend, we will use JavaScript along with the Node.js runtime and the Express framework. The database we will use is MongoDB.

### Possible Added Values:
- **English Support:** Platform available in English for a broader audience.
- **LaTeX Support:** Implement LaTeX for improved mathematical representation.

### Requirements:
- **Node.js** (Run environment)
- **npm** (Package manager)
- **GitHub repo** (Source code)
- **Victory** (Library for plots)
- **Plotly React** (Library for plots)

### Steps to Install and Run SolverPro

#### 1. Install Node.js:
- Go to [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Node.js.
- Execute the wizard downloaded and follow through the stages.
- After installation is complete, verify the installation by running the commands:
  ```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

#### 2. Clone GitHub Repository:
- You will need the repository link: [SolverPro GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MauricioCa07/SolverPro.git).
- Navigate to a directory of your preference on your computer and create a new folder with any name.
- Open the command prompt and navigate to the folder you just created.
- Run the command:
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
  This will create an empty local repository.
- Then, run the command to clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MauricioCa07/SolverPro.git
  ```

#### 3. Install Dependencies:
- In the same directory, run the following command to install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

#### 4. Install Libraries (If Needed):
- If required during execution, run the commands to install additional libraries:
  ```bash
  npm install react-plotly.js plotly.js
  npm install victory
  ```

#### 5. Run the Development Server:
- To run the project locally, execute the following command:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- This will return a URL of a localhost. Copy it and paste it in your browser to access the application.

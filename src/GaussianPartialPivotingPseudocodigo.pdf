/*
This algorithm implements the Gaussian elimination method with partial pivoting to solve
systems of linear equations. It is an improved variant of the standard Gaussian elimination
method that aims to minimize rounding errors and improve numerical stability.

The Gaussian elimination method with partial pivoting follows these main steps:

1. Pivot search: In each column, the element with the largest absolute value (pivot) is sought.
2. Row exchange: The current row is swapped with the row containing the pivot.
3. Elimination: The pivot is used to eliminate the elements below it in the column.
4. Back-substitution: The resulting triangular system is solved.

The formula for elimination in each step is:

    a[i,j] = a[i,j] - (a[i,k] / a[k,k]) * a[k,j]

Where:
    a[i,j] is the element in row i, column j
    k is the current pivot column

Partial pivoting improves numerical stability by reducing the growth of rounding errors,
especially in systems where coefficients vary significantly in magnitude.

The computational complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3) for an n x n matrix.
